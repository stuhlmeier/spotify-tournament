# spotify-tournament

## Project details

I initially wrote [the prototype](https://github.com/stuhlmeier/spotify-tournament/tree/prototype) for this in around 8
hours, but it quickly got too large and/or messy to be easily maintainable, so I rewrote it in Vue, which turned out to
be a very good choice.

There are a few features I'd like to add, and a few areas to still be cleaned up, but I'm currently still working on
them.

This is a web app for creating bracket tournaments of your Spotify songs (currently from either a playlist or an album).
In my experience, this is a more effective way to rank songs based on how much you like them, as it is generally easier
to compare two things at once rather than creating a list entirely from scratch.

This was also inspired by [the bracket posts over at r/CSHFans](https://www.reddit.com/r/CSHFans/comments/mja2if/).
